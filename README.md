# huffduff-rss 

Extracts a single Episode of a podcast and sends it to [Huffduffer](http://huffduffer.com/).

## Huffduffer?
A platform to curate your own podcast stream from Audio across the Internet

## Why?
I tend to stumble about interesting looking podcast episodes while surfing the Internet. However I dont want to subscribe to the podcast immediately. Hence I had to dig out the audio url, copy title and description and insert all that into huffduffer. This project tries to automate this.

## Bug
Yes, it is probably full of it. Send patches.
